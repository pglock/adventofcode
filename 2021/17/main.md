### Solution

Part 1 can be solved with a formula.

The start velocity in y is also the velocity times -1 if you're at y=0 again. If the target is y=-154..-101 the downwards step may not be larger than 153 or you miss the target zone.

Therefor the starting velocity is y=153 and the highest point is 153 * (153 + 1) / 2.
